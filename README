Experiment: 
    Problem: How many times your TM (your personal Computer) can 
    count in a limited time (Assume for 1 Second)?
    .
    Answer: The main.cpp program Counted 600 million times
    in a 2nd thread! (1st thread is the Main thread):
        "TM Main counted 600000000 times in 1.0003 second!"

    Note0: Human being can count up to 10 in the same amount of time!    

Instruction to run the program:
  $ g++ main.cpp -o main -pthread -std=c++14
  $ ./main
    Notice that counter.cpp is Linked using Linker <>
    to main.cpp, thus you only use main.cpp in the 
    above compile command!    

Note1: main.s is Assembly Language file which is
created by Compiler given main.cpp is already preprocessed.
    $ g++ -S main.cpp

Note2: a.out is created by Assembler and is a machine Language
    $ g++ -C main.cpp
